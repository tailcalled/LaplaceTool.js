			What is this? Basically, Laplace's Law of Succession tells you what you know
			after a survey. Imagine you have some population, and you want to know how
			many people in this population belongs to some subset.
		</p>
		<p>
			It can be any subset - red hair, rich, parents, whatever. Laplace's Law of
			Succession assumes you know nothing about the subset beforehand.
		</p>
		<p>
			To find out how many are in the subset, you obviously go out and measure.
			However, it would be too expensive to measure everybody, so instead you
			only measure a small sample. This obviously doesn't give you perfect information,
			but it does tell you something.
		</p>
		<p>
			To find out <i>what exactly</i> you know, this tool becomes useful: simply
			enter the results of your survey, and it can give you the probability of
			a given rate of members in the subset. In addition, you can also specify
			some probability that you can accept to make mistakes, and it will tell
			you an interval that with this probability contains the actual rate.
